/**
 * The merged surface: three titles, one listener, driven over a real socket against THREE databases.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS IS THE ONLY TEST THAT SEES WHAT THE PROCESS ACTUALLY IS.**
 *
 * `server.test.ts` drives emberkin alone, `aetherholm/server.test.ts` drives aetherholm alone and
 * `nda/server.test.ts` drives nda alone, and all three still pass unchanged — which is how we know
 * the merge did not alter any title's own surface, and also the reason none of them can see any of
 * the five things a merge can break:
 *
 *   1. **A route reading the wrong module's database.** The kernel resolves ONE handle per request
 *      from ONE selector. Mounted without `RouteSpec.sql`, a module's handlers would be handed
 *      emberkin's database — and FOUR table names exist in all three schemas with the SAME columns
 *      (`outbox`, `event_subscriptions`, `outbox_deliveries`, `inbox`), while emberkin and
 *      aetherholm share `seasons` and `battles` on top. `select … from seasons` would SUCCEED
 *      against another game's rows. No single-module suite can see it, because in each of them
 *      there is only one database.
 *   2. **Two `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`.** Matching is first-wins, so the second copy of each
 *      is simply dead — and a dead health endpoint looks exactly like a live one.
 *   3. **A `/readyz` that reports part of the process.** Emberkin's Lifecycle probing only
 *      emberkin's database answers 200 while every city, fleet, world and day resolution is
 *      failing — and `aetherholm-web` reads that endpoint through `cf-api-aetherholm-readyz` to
 *      tell a player whether the game is up.
 *   4. **An erasure that reaches one title.** ALL THREE subscribe to `identity.user.deleted`. One
 *      webhook routing it to one module answers 202 to a deletion two thirds of which never
 *      happened, and nothing retries because nothing failed.
 *   5. **Job metrics that erase each other.** `jobs_pending` and `jobs_overdue` carry no `kind`,
 *      so before the `module` label each module's sample OVERWROTE the others' and a wedged queue
 *      was ABSENT from the graph rather than high.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Three databases are required, and the suite skips without all three. It is the one file in this
 * repository that needs `EMBERKIN_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `AETHERHOLM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` and
 * `NDA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` at once, and `service-ci.yml` provides exactly that — one CI database per
 * declared variable, for the reason `migratortargets.test.ts` measures.

 * ── THE AETHERHOLM MODULE VALIDATES ITS CONFIGURATION AT IMPORT AND EXITS ON A BAD ONE ─────────
 *
 * Right for a service, fatal for a test runner — `aetherholm/env.test.ts` records the same problem
 * and solves it the same way. So a complete environment is populated FIRST and the module is then
 * imported dynamically.
 *
 * The signing secret is generated per run rather than written as a literal, for the reason
 * micro-org #142 records at length: a hyphenated placeholder that clears a length check is the
 * exact family of value the estate actually shipped, and no repository should hold a string that
 * looks like key material. `assertGeneratedSecret` refuses one anyway.
 *
 * The DSN is this suite's own test database, so the module's aetherholm half reads the same
 * database `resetAetherholm` truncates.
