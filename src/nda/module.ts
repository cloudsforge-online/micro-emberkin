/**
 * The nda module: the third title in this process, constructed behind one function.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS FILE IS THE DATABASE BOUNDARY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE JOB.**
 *
 * Wave M4a (micro-deploy `docs/service-merge-plan.md`, which pre-authorised it in so many words:
 * "`nda` can join later as a third module once the pattern is proven") folds Ninety Days After
 * into emberkin's process. All three databases are KEPT — `EMBERKIN_DATABASE_URL`,
 * `AETHERHOLM_DATABASE_URL`, `NDA_DATABASE_URL`, no schema merge — and the three schemas own
 * **four tables of the same name in all three of them**: `outbox`, `event_subscriptions`,
 * `outbox_deliveries` and `inbox`.
 *
 * That is what makes this boundary different from an ordinary module seam. A handler handed the
 * wrong handle does not fail. `insert into inbox …` SUCCEEDS against another title's inbox and
 * dedupes an event this database has never seen — no exception, no log line, no metric. The only
 * way to know is a reconciliation nobody runs.
 *
 * So the boundary is made out of SCOPE and out of TYPE, in four layers, each of which fails on its
 * own — the same four `aetherholm/module.ts` documents, for the same reasons:
 *
 *   1. **`./env.ts` is imported HERE and nowhere above.** `NDA_DATABASE_URL` and
 *      `NDA_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL` enter the process in this file's import graph and in no other.
 *      `src/index.ts` — the merged composition root — never sees a DSN or a credential of this
 *      module's, so it cannot hand one anywhere.
 *   2. **Every route this module exports carries `RouteSpec.sql`**, stamped once by
 *      `mountableRoutes` in `./server.ts`, over the whole table. The kernel resolves `ctx.sql`
 *      from the selector the route named, so an nda handler is handed nda's database by
 *      construction rather than by care.
 *   3. **Each module's handlers close over their OWN deps.** `handle` takes only `ctx`, so no
 *      handler has a `deps` parameter through which the host's queue, billing client or pools
 *      could arrive. `deps.queueFor` reaches ONE database's `jobs` table; sharing a bag would put
 *      this title's `world.tick` rows in emberkin's database, where nothing claims them.
 *   4. **`inbound.deliver` takes a NETWORK, never a handle.** The one route this module does not
 *      mount — `POST /v1/events`, emberkin's — reaches it through an interface with no parameter
 *      a database handle could arrive through. It resolves its own.
 *
 * `../merged.test.ts` fails in two places if layer 2 is removed, and it checks THIS module's
 * database directly rather than trusting a 202.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS THAT AETHERHOLM'S DID NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * aetherholm calls nothing at all. This one calls billing and worlds, and holds
 * `NDA_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL` to do it. Three consequences, all deliberate:
 *
 *   * **Its upstream set is a strict SUBSET of the host's.** emberkin already reaches ledger,
 *     billing, worlds and identity; this module reaches billing, worlds and identity. So the
 *     merged process's reach does not widen by a single peer — which is the whole argument for
 *     this wave, and it is checked rather than asserted in `../mergedupstreams.test.ts`.
 *   * **It brings a HARD readiness probe of its own**, `nda-identity-credential`. That is nda's
 *     standalone behaviour preserved exactly: a replica with no credential can make no
 *     authenticated call and must take no traffic. It is also the one place where this merge
 *     genuinely widens what can make the pod unready, and `../merged.test.ts` says so.
 *   * **It does NOT re-probe billing, worlds or the JWKS.** The host already probes those three
 *     URLs, softly, under those three names, read from the same estate-wide variables. A second
 *     copy would be two identical checks in one `/readyz` report and one more thing to keep in
 *     step.
 *
 * Everything else below is `nda/src/index.ts` as it stood, in the same order and for the same
 * stated reasons. What changed is only what a module in somebody else's process cannot own: the
 * listener, the `Lifecycle` and the `Metrics` registry are the HOST's and are passed in; the
 * database pools, the job planes and the job runners are this module's and are built here.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does **not** do: run migrations. That is `../migrator.ts`, a
 * separate one-shot. It asserts the schema version and refuses to serve below it, because below
 * `SCHEMA_VERSION` the jobs, outbox and idempotency tables may not exist, and the
 * `players_world_user_uniq` index that keeps one account to one survivor may not exist either.

 * Wave M3 had one such collision. Without a `module` label,
 * `jobs_failed_total{kind="achievement.deliver"}` is the sum of two unrelated bridges into two
 * different `worlds` profiles, and no query can take them apart — an alert fires and names a
 * service that is now three titles.
 *
 * `jobs_pending` and `jobs_overdue` are worse, and they are what
