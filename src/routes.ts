/**
 * The HTTP surface: emberkin's routes, each handler closed over emberkin's dependency bag.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * `POST /v1/events` is SIGNATURE-CHECKED BEFORE IT IS PARSED. An event webhook with no MAC lets
 * anyone who can reach the port assert a customer bought a season pass and get the reward paid, so
 * the body is verified against `OUTBOX_ACCEPT_SECRETS` over the exact bytes received, with a
 * timing-safe comparison, before `JSON.parse`. The handler then dedupes on the source event id via
 * `withInbox` and enqueues a leased reward job — it never posts to the ledger inline, so a ledger
 * outage cannot make the producer's relay redeliver.
 *
 * The SCHEME is `@cloudsforge/contracts-events`', not this repository's. It used to be a local
 * `sha256=<hmac>` under a locally-spelled header, which no producer in the estate sends, so every
 * inbound delivery answered 403 and every event this service emitted was refused by its consumers.
 * `outbox.ts` holds the measurement and the reason there is still a second, legacy arm.
 *
 * It serves TWO topics on that one route, `SUBSCRIBED_TOPICS`: `billing.entitlement.granted` and
 * `identity.user.deleted` (rule 6 of 03 §2 — see `erasure.ts` for what erasure means per table).
 * Anything else is 202'd and ignored, because a 4xx makes the producer's relay retry for ever.
 *
 * The fail-open / fail-closed split on cosmetics:
 *   `GET /v1/saves/me`            fails OPEN — it runs on every app load and reads only our own data.
 *   `PUT /v1/saves/me/cosmetics`  fails CLOSED with a 503 on a billing outage — "ask again later",
 *                                 never "wear it anyway".
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **EVERY HANDLER CLOSES OVER `deps`; NONE TAKES IT AS A PARAMETER.** `createRoutes` is called once
 * with this module's dependency bag and returns specs the kernel can mount without ever seeing the
 * verifier, the queues or the game data. That is what lets aetherholm's routes be mounted beside
 * these in one process with a bag of its own — see `kernel.ts` and `aetherholm/module.ts`.
 *
 * It is also what removed `forRequest`. The per-network job queue used to be swapped into a copy
 * of `deps` on the way in, SYNCHRONOUSLY, in the request listener — and `queueFor` throws for a
 * network this deployment does not hold, so that throw was an uncaught exception in a listener and
 * node exits on those. It is now `deps.queueFor(ctx.network)` at the two places that enqueue,
 * inside the handler, where a throw is a rejected promise the kernel already catches.
 * `ownnetwork.test.ts` asserts both halves of that.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **`identity.user.deleted` IS SUBSCRIBED BY BOTH TITLES, AND THAT IS WHY THIS EXISTS.**
 *
 * Before the merge, identity's relay held one subscription row per service and delivered the same
 * erasure twice — once to emberkin, once to aetherholm — and each erased its own nine-or-so
 * `user_id` columns. After the merge there is ONE endpoint. Route the event to one module and the
 * other title never erases: the deletion answers 202, the producer marks it delivered, and every
 * city that person founded is still standing. There is no retry, because nothing failed.
 *
 * Registering TWO subscription rows both pointing at the merged URL does not fix it either — it is
 * worse. The same event id would arrive twice at one endpoint and `withInbox` would dedupe the
 * second delivery away, which is the same silence with a second row to make it look handled.
 *
 * So the route verifies ONCE and fans out to every module that subscribes, each against its own
 * database, its own `inbox` table and its own erasure. `merged.test.ts` fails if the fan-out is
 * removed, and it checks the aetherholm database directly rather than trusting the 202.
