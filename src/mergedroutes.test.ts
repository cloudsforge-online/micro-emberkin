/**
 * The three route tables, measured against each other.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **A COLLIDING PATH IS NOT AN ERROR. IT IS A ROUTE THAT SILENTLY STOPS BEING REACHABLE.**
 *
 * `mountRoutes` matches FIRST-WINS over a flat list, and the merged listener puts emberkin's table
 * first (`createMergedServer`). So any path two titles declare resolves to whichever was
 * concatenated first and the other's copy is dead — no exception, no warning, no metric. `/livez`
 * answering 200 from the wrong module looks exactly like `/livez` answering 200 from the right one.
 *
 * Four paths collide today, in every pair, and every one of them is deliberately dropped from what
 * a mounted module contributes (`aetherholm/module.ts` and `nda/server.ts`, `UNMOUNTED`):
 *
 *   `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`   one process serves one of each; emberkin's win, and
 *                                      `/readyz` reflects ALL THREE databases (see `merged.test.ts`).
 *   `POST /v1/events`                  one webhook for the process, which VERIFIES once and then
 *                                      FANS OUT. All three titles subscribe to
 *                                      `identity.user.deleted`; shadowing this one would be a
 *                                      deletion that answers 202 while two thirds never happened.
 *
 * This file exists so that a FIFTH collision — a route any title adds later — is a red build
 * rather than a route that quietly stops working. It computes the overlaps rather than listing
 * them, and it computes them for every PAIR, because the merged table is a concatenation and a
 * collision between two MOUNTED modules is just as silent as one with the host.
 *
 * ── AND THIS IS THE FILE THAT REFUSED TESSERA ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Wave M4a was scoped as "emberkin absorbs nda AND tessera". It absorbs nda only, and this is the
 * measurement that decided it: `GET /v1/title` and `POST /v1/provision` are not this repository's
 * paths to choose. They are `TITLE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH` and `PROVISION_PATH`, frozen constants in
 * `@cloudsforge/contracts-worlds`, and aetherholm and tessera BOTH mount them. In one process the
 * second title's descriptor is dead and `worlds` provisioning a paid tessera ward is answered — 200
 * — by aetherholm's handler. There is no `UNMOUNTED` entry that fixes it, because unlike
 * `/v1/events` there is no second way in: `worlds` addresses a title by BASE URL and appends a
 * fixed path. The case at the foot of this file pins that, so the next person to propose it finds
 * the reason before the rework.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * No database: `createRoutes` and `buildRoutes` build closures and query nothing. This suite
 * therefore runs in the no-DSN case too, which is where a route-table regression is cheapest to
 * catch.
