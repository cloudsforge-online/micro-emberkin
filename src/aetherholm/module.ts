/**
 * The aetherholm module: this half of the merged process, constructed behind one function.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS FILE IS THE DATABASE BOUNDARY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE JOB.**
 *
 * Wave M3 (micro-deploy `docs/service-merge-plan.md`) folds this title into emberkin's process.
 * Both databases are KEPT — `EMBERKIN_DATABASE_URL` and `AETHERHOLM_DATABASE_URL`, no schema
 * merge — and the two schemas own **six tables of the same name**: `outbox`,
 * `event_subscriptions`, `outbox_deliveries`, `inbox`, `seasons` and `battles`.
 *
 * That is what makes this boundary different from an ordinary module seam. A handler handed the
 * wrong handle does not fail. `select … from seasons` SUCCEEDS, reads the other title's season,
 * and reports nothing — no exception, no log line, no metric. The only way to know is a
 * reconciliation nobody runs.
 *
 * So the boundary is made out of SCOPE and out of TYPE, in four layers, each of which fails on its
 * own:
 *
 *   1. **`./env.ts` is imported HERE and nowhere above.** `AETHERHOLM_DATABASE_URL` enters the
 *      process in this file's import graph and in no other. `src/index.ts` — the merged
 *      composition root — never sees a DSN of this module's, so it cannot hand one anywhere.
 *   2. **Every route this module exports carries `RouteSpec.sql`**, stamped once by
 *      `mountableRoutes` below, over the whole table. The kernel resolves `ctx.sql` from the
 *      selector the route named, so an aetherholm handler is handed aetherholm's database by
 *      construction rather than by care.
 *   3. **Each module's handlers close over their OWN deps.** `handle` takes only `ctx`, so no
 *      handler has a `deps` parameter through which the host's queue, producer or pools could
 *      arrive. `deps.queue` is a handle on ONE database's `jobs` table; sharing a bag would put
 *      this title's `city.queue` rows in emberkin's database, where nothing claims them.
 *   4. **`inbound.deliver` takes a NETWORK, never a handle.** The one route this module does not
 *      mount — `POST /v1/events`, emberkin's — reaches it through an interface with no parameter
 *      a database handle could arrive through. It resolves its own.
 *
 * `merged.test.ts` fails in two places if layer 2 is removed, and it checks THIS module's database
 * directly rather than trusting a 202.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Everything below is `aetherholm/src/index.ts` as it stood, in the same order and for the same
 * stated reasons. What changed is only what a module in somebody else's process cannot own: the
 * listener, the `Lifecycle`, the `Verifier` and the `Metrics` registry are the HOST's and are
 * passed in; the database pools, the job queue and the job runner are this module's and are built
 * here.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does **not** do: run migrations. That is `src/migrator.ts`, a
 * separate one-shot — AD-17 and rule 7. It asserts the schema version and refuses to serve below
 * it, because below `SCHEMA_VERSION` the outbox/inbox tables, the city stock CHECKs and the
 * provision uniqueness may not exist.
 *
 * There are still no upstream clients: this title makes no outbound HTTP call, so its only hard
 * probe is Postgres and it contributes exactly that to the host's readiness.

 * ever notice was dead. Emberkin's win, because it is the host and because Prometheus scrapes this
 * target under emberkin's job.
 *
 * `POST /v1/events` is the fourth, and it is the one that is not merely about shadowing. Both
 * titles subscribe to `identity.user.deleted`. Mounted second, this module's copy would be
 * SHADOWED by emberkin's and every erasure would silently stop reaching this database — a deletion
 * that answers 202 while every city that person founded stays standing. So the route is dropped
 * here and this module joins the host's single webhook through `inbound` instead, which fans out
 * to every module that subscribes. `merged.test.ts` asserts the overlap between the two path sets
 * is EXACTLY these four, so a fifth collision appearing later is a red test rather than a route
 * that quietly stops being reachable.
 *
 * It is a filter and NOT a deletion from `routes.ts` because that table is also the standalone
 * listener's, which `server.test.ts`, `titlecontract.test.ts` and `erasure.test.ts` all drive —
