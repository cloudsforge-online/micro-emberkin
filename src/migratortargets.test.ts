/**
 * Two modules, two migration ledgers, and the assertion that keeps them apart.
 *
 * `@cloudsforge/db` records applied migrations in a table called `schema_migrations`. The name is a
 * literal in that package — `LEDGER_SQL` — and `MigrateOptions` offers no way to change it, so two
 * modules migrating ONE database write into ONE ledger keyed by `version`. Both modules number
 * their migrations from 1.
 *
 * The failure that produces is not a crash and would not be found by reading a log. Whichever
 * module runs first records versions 1..N; the second finds those rows, treats its own 1..N as
 * applied, creates nothing, and the migrator exits 0. Nothing is red until the NEXT release's
 * `assertSchemaAtLeast` refuses to serve — naming a version number, in a service, hours later.
 *
 * Nor does anything else catch it: the advisory lock is derived from the SERVICE name and the two
 * names differ, so the two runs do not even serialise against each other.
 *
 * So it is refused before a statement is issued, and this file is why that refusal is trustworthy.
